## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you? The SMART acronym was a new way of presenting something I have encountered before. Not being afraid to make mistakes; I am not afraid to make mistakes on my own, but to share them out to the people around me is difficult.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_? Seeking out challenges. As mentioned above, I am definitely to run my mistakes up the flagpole (which ultimately means I don't ask for help when I do encounter a problem).

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
`def hair color
  if hair == blond
    puts "Surf's up, dude!"
  elsif hair == brown
    puts "You're a deep thinker, aren't you?"
  elsif hair == red
    puts "Look out, this one has a temper!"
  else
    puts "At least you have a nice, shiny head!"
  end`

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement? It allows a "fork in the road," an option whether you want to go this way or the other.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
`If x >= y
  puts "That's a lot of yaks."`

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement? Nesting if statements within if statements.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:      `elsif yo-yo == red
  puts "How nice and sparkly!"`
